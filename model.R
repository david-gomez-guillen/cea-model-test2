# A cost-effectiveness model of screening for a hypothetical cancer.
#
# It is a Markov cohort model. Rather than following people one by one, it keeps
# track of which share of a group of people, the cohort, is in each health state,
# and moves those shares from state to state once a year.
#
#   Cycle:       one year
#   Horizon:     from age 20 to age 89
#   Strategies:  no screening, or screening rounds at fixed ages, done with a
#                test or with a procedure
#
# Cancer grows out of a lesion, along one of two pathways:
#
#   slow:  normal -> low-grade lesion -> high-grade lesion -> cancer
#   fast:  normal -> fast-pathway lesion -> cancer
#
# A cancer starts out preclinical, which means nobody knows it is there. It is
# localized first and advanced later, and it is diagnosed when it gives symptoms
# or when a screening round finds it. Screening pays off in two ways: it removes
# lesions before they turn into cancer, and it finds cancers while they are
# still localized and easier to cure.
#
# The file reads top to bottom: the states, the parameters, the yearly
# transitions, what a screening round does, and simulate(), which puts them
# together.
